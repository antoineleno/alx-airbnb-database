# Optimization Report

## Objective
Refactor complex queries to improve performance.

## Initial Query
See `perfomance.sql`.

## Performance Analysis
Used `EXPLAIN` to analyze the query. Identified issues:
- Full table scans on `users`, `properties`, and `payments`.
- Joins not using indexes efficiently.

## Refactoring Actions
- Ensured indexes on `bookings.user_id`, `bookings.property_id`, `payments.booking_id`.
- Confirmed `id` columns are indexed (primary key).
Objective: Refactor complex queries to improve performance.

Instructions:

Write an initial query that retrieves all bookings along with the user details, property details, and payment details and save it on perfomance.sql

Analyze the queryâ€™s performance using EXPLAIN and identify any inefficiencies.

Refactor the query to reduce execution time, such as reducing unnecessary joins or using indexing.
